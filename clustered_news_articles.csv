,https://www.herald.co.zw/chivi-bids-farewell-to-national-hero-brig-gen-vezha/,"George Maponga in CHIVI HUNDREDS of people from all walks of life yesterday thronged the Vezha homestead in Zangure Village, Madzivire area in the Shindi communal lands, to bid farewell to national hero Brigadier-General Shadreck Vezha, who was making his last visit home before interment at the National Heroes Acre on Monday next week. The senior military officer and freedom fighter died on Tuesday last week in a road traffic accident and was declared a national hero due to his contribution to the liberation of Zimbabwe and the sterling service he extended to his motherland in the post-independence era. He was 63. A sombre atmosphere engulfed the Vezha rural homestead as an AFZ helicopter carrying his body landed in his place of birth to enable relatives, friends and villagers to bid him farewell. His body, that was in a white casket draped with the national flag, was accompanied to Zangure Village by his son Tafadzwa Vezha, the Senior Chaplin General at the Zimbabwe Defence Forces Headquarters, Colonel Dr Ashani Bwanali and other relatives and military officers. Before flying to his birthplace at Zangure village, Brigadier-General Vezha’s body first passed through his farm in Sherwood, Kwekwe to also allow other close family members to bid him farewell. On hand to receive his body was the Minister of State for Masvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution Ezra Chadzamira, the permanent secretary in his office Dr Addmore Pazvakavambwa and service chiefs. Zanu PF Masvingo provincial chair Cde Robson Mavhenyengwa was also present to welcome Brigadier-General Vezha’s body. Speaking during a funeral service held at the Vezha homestead, his father Mr Gibson Chimbeva, thanked President Mnangagwa and his Government for conferring national hero status on his son, saying they felt honoured by such recognition. “I am also happy even as I mourn my departed son that the Government has seen it fit that his body also comes to his birthplace to bid him farewell before going to his final resting place at the Heroes Acre,’’ he said. The Brigadier-General’s mother, Mrs Jemina Chitotsa, also thanked President Mnangagwa for conferring national hero status on her son, noting that the Vezha family had lost a pillar of support. Chivi South legislator Cde Felix Maburutse, who is young brother to Brigadier-General Vezha said his family had lost a hard worker and dependable character who was committed to the development of his nation. Zangure village head Mr Ephius Zangure was full of praise for President Mnangagwa for honouring Brigadier General Vezha. “We are honoured and happy as the people of Zangure that we now have our own son who has been declared a national hero, this is the first time this has happened and this is all due to the love, sacrifices and commitment shown by Shadreck to his motherland.’’ Minister Chadzamira, who was the chief mourner, said the province had been robbed of a liberation war stalwart and hard worker who was committed to the development of Masvingo province and the nation at large. Minister Chadzamira thanked President Mnangagwa for according national hero status on Brigadier-General Vezha, saying the province was proud to have moulded exceptional individuals whose commitment to the development of the motherland was well known. He said the only way for Masvingo province to pay homage to illustrious sons of the soil like Brigadier-General Vezha was to continue tirelessly working for the development of Zimbabwe and make sure the country is food-self sufficient and attains its Vision 2030 goals. Minister Chadzamira challenged young people to emulate Brigadier-General Vezha’s record of outstanding service to his motherland before and after independence. He chronicled his history from the time of his birth in Zangure village up to his death when he was a senior army officer, saying his elevation at work was evidence of his unflinching loyalty and dedication to his country. In his address, Cde Mavhenyengwa said the ruling Zanu PF party was poorer without Brigadier-General Vezha and challenged the revolutionary party’s supporters to uphold discipline, taking a leaf from dedicated warriors like the late national hero. A church service led by the Roman Catholic Church was held to give  Brigadier-General Vezha a perfect send-off after which Minister Chadzamira led mourners in body viewing.",1
,https://www.herald.co.zw/starlink-applies-for-zim-licence/,"Bulawayo Bureau THE Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) says the global satellite internet provider, Starlink, which is owned by American tycoon, Mr Elon Musk, has applied to operate in the country. Potraz director-general Dr Gift Machengete revealed this in Bulawayo on Tuesday during a question and answer session at a business function organised by the Ministry of Information Communication Technology (ICTs), Postal and Courier Services on the sidelines of the ongoing 64th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). Starlink has become a topic of concern in the country’s ICT sector, with questions being raised on how it operates given its continued consumer growth and popularity worldwide. Responding to the issue, Dr Machengete said the regulator was seized with the matter and was processing the application papers by Starlink. “Then, why is Starlink not operating right now? The simple answer is Starlink had not applied and we would be foolish to then go and say come and apply, please. “Now they have come to apply and we are in the process of looking at their application,” said Dr Machengete. “We are also a regulator, we need to see how we regulate them. We also have to look at consumer and data protection. “But, currently we are in the process of looking at their application.” He acknowledged that there have been some illegal users of Starlink in the country who have since been cut off. “So, in short we have not banned them. What we have just done is that those who have been using Starlink terminals were asked to have Starlink switch them off because we cannot allow illegality,” said Dr Machengete. “I think they have been switched off and maybe there is some outcry. But, you see those were illegal and they will be regularised when they are licenced”. He said the authority has a role to play in the operation of the telecommunications sector and will follow the right channels in ensuring services are provided and they meet the standards. “Let me explain that at Potraz we are the licencing authority for telecommunications and we actually have a licencing framework and that framework is a converged framework whereby we check if the technology that you bring is not relevant, it is technology neutral and to reinforce that we already had geo-stationary satellites. “We already have geo-stationary satellites licenced so there is no way we would then be blocking Starlink because we are technology neutral,” said Dr Machengete. Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American aerospace company, SpaceX, providing coverage to over 70 countries. It also aims to provide global mobile broadband. SpaceX started launching Starlink satellites in 2019. As of early March 2024 it consisted of over 6 000 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) that communicate with designated ground transceivers. Nearly 12 000 satellites are planned to be deployed, with a possible later extension to 34 400. SpaceX announced reaching more than one million subscribers in December 2022, 1,5 million subscribers in May 2023, and two million subscribers in September 2023.",3
,https://www.herald.co.zw/audits-of-zig-money-supply-once-a-year-rbz/,"Farirai Machivenyika-Senior Reporter ZIMBABWE should use its own currency to achieve higher levels of economic growth while the supply of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) will always match increases in gold and cash reserves, with audits of money supply expected to be conducted at least once a year, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, has said. In addition, negotiations involving stakeholders are underway to explore the possibility of selling fuel in ZiG as part of measures to boost and promote its use. Dr Mushayavanhu said this when he appeared before a joint sitting of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, and Industry and Commerce on Tuesday. The RBZ chief announced the introduction of the ZiG, which is mainly backed by the country’s gold and foreign currency reserves and other minerals, when he presented his first Monetary Policy Statement nearly two weeks ago. “We are still negotiating and making considerations on how best we can allow the sale of fuel in ZiG,” he said. “We started on taxes and included other commodities and people are going to be advised. “We need to do our work gradually and we are going to reach that (point) where fuel is sold in ZiG. “For a country to grow, you need to transact in your local currency and we are starting at 15 percent and we expect to grow that to 30, 40, 50 percent or even higher by 2026.” Dr Mushayavanhu also told the MPs that an annual audit of reserves would be done with findings publicised to ensure the Central Bank sticks to its policy pronouncements. “We will have an audit once by registered auditors, be it international firms or local ones,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu added that the Central Bank was also open to increasing the frequency of the audits following questions from legislators. “We can do that if Honourable Members want that although it would be ideal to have one audit a year so that the auditors retain their independence,” he said. Dr Mushayavanhu reiterated that the Central Bank will not print money that does not correspond to reserves it holds. “Any increase in money supply will be met by a concomitant increase in reserves and will also be linked to productivity, inflation and other variables and I can assure the public that we will stick to that,” he said. At the moment, Zimbabwe has US$80 million worth of ZiG in circulation backed by US$100 million in cash and US$185 million worth of gold reserves. Government has also directed that companies pay 50 percent of their taxes in ZiG to promote its economy wide use. Dr Mushayavanhu said the Intermediate Money Transfer Tax, commonly referred to as the 2 percent tax that is presently pegged at 1 percent for US dollar transactions and 2 percent for ZiG transactions, would soon be brought to parity between the two currencies. Monetary authorities have also agreed with Treasury to scrap the provisions of SI 118A allowing traders to charge goods and services at a rate of up to 10 percent of the official rate amid concerns by legislators that this was also fuelling parallel market rates. Treasury is expected to make pronouncements on the matter soon.",3
,https://www.herald.co.zw/arda-in-mission-to-revive-460-irrigation-schemes/,"Zvamaida Murwira-Senior Reporter THE Agricultural and Rural Development Authority will lead in the revival of 460 irrigation schemes where it will employ a manager at each scheme responsible for cropping and marketing of products as the Government steps up efforts to mitigate the climate-change induced drought, a senior official has said. Agricultural and Rural Development Advisory Services acting chief director, Mr Leonard Munamati, said reviving irrigation schemes and consolidating existing ones was part of measures meant to combat the effects of drought in the event that it does not rain sufficiently enough, as happened in the 2023/2024 summer cropping season. He said this during a Star FM current affairs radio programme, “Muriro on Monday”, which discussed various measures being initiated to combat the effects of drought. “We actually have 460 irrigation schemes in the country. We want to upscale production on these 460 irrigation schemes, communal, old resettlement, A1, all these should be doing wheat this winter season and probably horticulture for nutrition and income,” said Mr Munamati. “We need to increase production and productivity. We are going to use Arda where it employs a scheme business manager who will be resident on the scheme and these managers will help in cropping, marketing, and availing resources to the scheme so that they become functional. “We believe these schemes are going to be useful in drought mitigation measures.” Mr Munamati said Zimbabwe’s food security will be based on wheat, adding that Government had put in place several measures to ensure the country is food secure. “We are going to make sure that our food security is wheat based. Remember we had some excess wheat that we produced last year and that excess wheat will be used as part of the Strategic Grain Reserve together with small quantities of maize and traditional grains that we have at the Grain Marketing Board. “That will be our starting point in terms of assisting vulnerable households that did not harvest. We are also saying, ‘yes this year we had a drought but we are going to have something, remember we had 75 000 hectares that was under irrigation in terms of maize’. “We are expecting a bit of harvest from the irrigated maize as well as a few hectarages that managed to produce grain that was under Pfumvudza (Intwasa) and other schemes. That should be able to push them up to the time we also get help from imports. The private sector is coming in and got permission to import as much as they can.” Once there is increased wheat output, the effects of drought would be managed, said Mr Munamati, adding that by October this year, wheat harvesting should start. The target for wheat hectarage has been increased from 90 000ha last year to 120 000ha this year. Speaking on the same programme, Agricultural Industry Development Support Institute for Southern Africa head of programmes, Mr Joseph Choga, commended the Government for coming up with measures to contain drought. “It is important that we understand the animal we are talking about when we talk of this year’s drought. It is hard-hitting,” he said. President Mnangagwa has acknowledged the food shortages and recently declared a State of Disaster over a drought after erratic rains caused a weather phenomenon called El Niño.",2

Govt to increase funding for sexual reproductive health,https://www.herald.co.zw/govt-to-increase-funding-for-sexual-reproductive-health/,"Rumbidzayi Zinyuke-Senior Health Reporter Government has pledged to increase domestic funding to ensure effective and accelerated progress towards the provision of Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) for all. While the country has made significant strides in the past decade, inequalities continue to disadvantage many women and girls. This was revealed in the findings from the 2024 State of the World Population Report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which showed that over 70 percent maternal deaths are still being recorded in sub-Saharan Africa. Speaking at the launch of the report on Monday, Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora emphasised the need for a significant shift towards comprehensive, accessible SRHR services for all. “To ensure that the next 30 years of progress includes everyone, we must pivot towards providing comprehensive, universal and inclusive sexual and reproductive health care and guaranteeing rights for all, regardless of their background,” he said. “This means designing tailored and targeted health programmes that address the multiple ways economic, social, political and environmental injustice impact people’s health and rights. “It also means moving beyond measuring human experiences in broad averages and committing to the collection of disaggregated data across a variety of factors.” He said the Government had already committed funds from the National Budget to support areas such as the procurement of contraceptives, pledging to explore more innovative financing mechanisms to ensure full, effective and accelerated implementation of the ICPD programme of action. Government invested US$3 million between 2022 and 2023 towards contraceptives, making Zimbabwe the first country under the UNFPA Supplies Global Partnership to receive match funding to complement the investment in family planning. Minister Mombeshora acknowledged that the country still had some unfinished business that included a high rate of adolescent pregnancy, among others. He said investment in education, health, social development and promotion of youth engagement in relevant development and economic issues was paramount. The SWOP report showed that despite many global gains in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) over the last 30 years, many women and girls in marginalised communities still struggle to access SRHR. Entitled “Interwoven Lives, Threads of Hope: Ending inequalities in sexual and reproductive health and rights”, the report highlights the role racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination continue to play in blocking broad gains in SRH for women and girls. It also highlights that women and girls who are poor, belong to ethnic, racial and indigenous minority groups, or are trapped in conflict settings, are more likely to die because they lack access to timely health care. UNFPA country representative Ms Miranda Tabifor said there was more to be done to address the disparities highlighted in the report. “In the space of a generation, we have reduced the unintended pregnancy rate by nearly one fifth, lowered the maternal death rate by one third, and secured laws against domestic violence in more than 160 countries. Despite this progress, inequalities within our societies and health systems are widening, and we have not adequately prioritised reaching those furthest behind. Our work is incomplete but not impossible with sustained investment and global solidarity,” she said. European Union Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Jobst von Kirchmann, who was represented by Head of Cooperation Mr Franck Porte acknowledged Government’s efforts to invest in SRHR. “We acknowledge the Government of Zimbabwe’s domestic investments in procuring contraceptives, leading to one of the highest modern contraceptive prevalence rates in Africa. “This, along with the training of health workers and new friendly services, demonstrates Zimbabwe’s dedication to protecting women and girls. “While we celebrate our achievements, we acknowledge that there is still much work to be done. The health sector faces underfunding and a workforce crisis. “Gender inequalities did hinder access to health or HR services for some women and girls. The EU reaffirms its commitment to support Zimbabwe and its people along this journey, through ongoing and future assistance, working hand-in-hand to build a more inclusive society.”",4
Editorial Comment: Agency necessary to curb drugs scourge,https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-agency-necessary-to-curb-drugs-scourge/,"SO serious is the menace of drug abuse in Zimbabwe, and so multi-faceted is the need for a response, that a specialist Drug and Substance Abuse Agency, now proposed by Cabinet, makes a great deal of sense. The principles of the proposed enabling legislation were approved this week and a detailed Bill will now be prepared for debate within Parliament so that the new agency has a sound legal foundation. At the moment, the national response to what was recognised last year as a far more severe problem than originally thought has been co-ordinated through the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Drug and Substance Abuse, with the police providing the backbone of the response when it comes to enforcing the laws, and the Department of Social Services and Ministry of Health and Child Care the backbone of the rehabilitation response. But a lot of other ministries and agencies have had to be involved through the committee, and the wide swathe of expertise required clearly led to consideration of a specialist agency where much of the required expertise can be concentrated in a single organisation. The new agency also shows that there is general agreement that the war on drugs and drug abuse is not a short-term campaign, but rather a long and difficult operation, basically a permanent operation, that will have to go way beyond a single campaign. Even when we achieve victories and beat back drug abuse, there will still be need to be on permanent alert to interdict new supplies and prevent the rise of new supply gangs. So a permanent agency is required even if we do score major victories. The idea of a specialist agency is not unique to Zimbabwe. The United States, for example, created the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration in 1973, separate from the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) although under the same federal Justice Department, to lead and co-ordinate the war on drugs in the largest national market for illegal drugs in the world. One major advantage that a separate agency has, with its own staff and own budget, is that it can apply constant and consistent action against drug smuggling, drug supply lines, suppliers, street agents and users. And it can build up the intelligence sources and analysis that will lead to major operations. The police have been doing a good job in recent months, but cannot apply the same level of resources every day as other crimes also need to be fought and there needs to be major campaigns against other waves of crime, such as the recent operation against black market currency dealing. That said, a separate Drug Agency will need to work closely with the police and will need to call on other Government forces, perhaps even the Defence Forces, for agreed joint operations. For example, the Drug Agency might well discover that there is a major smuggling effort in progress, that will require border patrols, aerial surveillance and large combined units to surround and arrest gangs. The operations side of the Drug Agency will obviously include interdiction of smuggled supplies, hunting down of home-grown drugs such as mbanje plots, disruption of supply lines and breaking into dealer networks. This needs specialist and dedicated intelligence staff working single-mindedly on the problem. Joint operations then may come into play when the intelligence is applied. And the police, Zimra and Airports Authority will often bump into drug dealing during their normal operations and will need to have full co-operation from the Drugs Agency. It will not exist in a vacuum. At present, while a lot of Zimbabweans are involved in drug abuse, there is still a fairly low selection of illegal drugs available. We have home-grown mbanje and smuggled crystal meth as the main two, along with smuggled medicines that are banned in Zimbabwe because of their addictive side effects, but legal in neighbouring countries. We have seen some cocaine and some heroin, although there is not much evidence of wide use of these drugs in Zimbabwe. There appears to be good international intelligence and couriers have been caught, although we have no idea how many couriers have managed to escape the net and not been caught. It could be very few, it could be a significant number. But things could get a lot worse. On the home front the wide range of climatic conditions found in Zimbabwe means that other plants, such as opium poppies and at least one of the cocoa species used as the source of cocaine, could probably be grown somewhere in the country, and quite possibly in forest glades where they are difficult to spot. And the initial processing is not complicated. Our serious stress on technical education means that there is a growing pool of people who have the expertise to process drugs and manufacture drugs, should they turn from the bright lights of national and community development into darker corridors. So the future Drug Agency will be very busy looking at potential threats, as well as existing threats. Without actual details of the agency, we do not yet know how it will plug into the rehabilitation services needed by drug users. Presumably these will remain with specialised ministries, although the Drug Agency will probably want users undergoing treatment to also volunteer specific information on supply chains and the like. Converting the accepted principles of a Drug Agency into the required detailed legislation will obviously require care, to make sure that the new agency can operate effectively. There will also need to be administrative measures to make sure it can be properly staffed. But the drug problem in Zimbabwe is sufficiently widespread and potentially can get a lot worse, that we need to go into overdrive to beat it back, and bringing in a new specialist agency is one way of concentrating resources, but at the same time maintaining pressure on other fronts.",3

‘Genomic sequencing game-changer for cancer detection’,https://www.herald.co.zw/genomic-sequencing-game-changer-for-cancer-detection/,"Rumbidzayi Zinyuke-Senior Health Reporter Zimbabwe’s private health sector has taken the initiative to complement Government efforts to improve early detection of cancers and other diseases through the use of DNA. Cimas Medical Aid Society recently procured a genetic sequencing machine, making it one of the few organisations in possession of such technology that could revolutionise the detection of diseases and improve public health outcomes. By studying the genetic make up of any organism, including a human being, genetic sequencing can help identify infectious viruses and bacteria and so help medical experts work out what drugs or other treatment could be most effective, and in something like cancer, research can help identify people who might have a higher risk of a particular cancer. When dealing with people, genomics is the study of a person’s genes (the genome), including the interaction of those genes with each other and with the environment. The genome contains important clues about a person, from their ancestry to the way their body responds to diseases, medication and aging. The use of genomic sequencing became one of the valuable tools in the global and national response to the Covid-19 pandemic as it was used to track the spread of viruses, how the viruses were changing and how those changes could affect public health. Information from genetic surveillance, used together with clinical and epidemiological data, guided the development of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostic assays as well as decisions on public health and social measures. The Ministry of Health and Child Care introduced genomic sequencing in May 2021 through repurposing laboratory departments that had been dedicated to other viral diseases until then, making them able to respond to a far wider range of research and diagnostic uses. The coming on board of the private sector in this field, could revolutionise surveillance for other diseases and inform public health decisions. Speaking on the sidelines of a media tour of the Cimas medical laboratory last week, group medical advisor Dr Tsitsi Moyo said gene sequencing would pave way for improved research that would ensure that genome was included in all aspects of healthcare, from diagnostics to pharmaceuticals and every aspect of science. “What the sequencer does is to help us to look at the genetic makeup of the people that we are treating,” she said. “This is helping us in terms of screening for diseases. We can look at adults or children and identify who is prone to cancer, what kind of treatment can we use; then we can proactively plan from a public health perspective or even from a funding perspective. “We can proactively plan for what to expect in our population for the next five to 10 years into the future.” Presently, over 5 000 new cancer cases of all types are diagnosed in Zimbabwe annually, but the majority of these are not diagnosed in the early stages, thus increasing the mortality rates. The national cancer prevention and control strategy for Zimbabwe says early diagnosis of cancer is crucial in reducing cancer-related deaths. Dr Moyo said most treatments being used were generic, meaning some patients with resistance might not respond to it, hence genetic studies are used to ensure such patients receive treatments that are suited to their type of illness. “Cimas Medlabs is immensely proud to be at the forefront of genetic research and personalised medicine. “We remain committed to advancing medical knowledge and improving patient outcomes through ground-breaking research and technology,” she noted. Ms Laurels Nyamasoka, the Cimas Medlabs team leader for the lab sections, said the study of genomes would not only be used in the fight against cancer, but also understand how genes contribute to other diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. “You can use DNA studies in diagnostics and in preventative medicine where you are trying to see if someone has an increased risk of developing a certain disease or condition that has already been discovered to be associated with a gene or DNA. “You can also use DNA studies to assess a person’s lifestyle wellness and their response to diet, how each individual is able to break down different types of foods in their bodies,” said Dr Moyo.",4
Zanu PF restructuring exercise commences next month,https://www.herald.co.zw/zanu-pf-restructuring-exercise-commences-next-month/,"Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter ZANU PF will commence a restructuring exercise next month, beginning with party cells and villages to ensure that all members, regardless of their positions, are registered in the party structures. The convening of Provincial Coordinating Committees’ meetings from 4 and 5 May will kick-start the restructuring exercise. Every year, the ruling party embarks on a cell verification exercise to account for its membership – both the old ones and those joining the party. The move seeks to take stock of the party’s membership in line with its constitutional dictates. The commissariat department shall deploy Politburo members to address the PCC meetings on how the restructuring programme will be conducted. Zanu PF National Political Commissar, Cde Mike Bimha confirmed the development. “This circular is a follow-up on circular No. 1 of March 2024, and a circular dated 21 March 2024, both of which alluded to the commencement of the above programme. “Consequent to the above PCC meetings, provinces should call for inter-district meetings at all District Coordinating Committee centres on 11 and 12 April 2024,” said Cde Bimha in a circular. Each province, he said, should deploy its members of the PCC to go and address these inter-district meetings to cascade the message on the framework for the conduct of the restructuring programme at cell and village levels. “The inter-district meetings should be followed by nationwide inter-branch meetings to be held on 18 and 19 May 2024,” he said. Cde Bimha said the restructuring exercise should then effectively begin on May 20, 2024. “The inter-branch meetings are very important in this whole programme since it is the branch executive committees that are going to physically carry out the restructuring of the cells and villages under their jurisdiction with supervision from District and Provincial leadership,” said Cde Bimha. The elections of cell and village executive committees shall be done through secret ballot, with the new leadership tasked to immediately conduct verification of the members of their respective cells and villages to flush out imposters. Cde Bimha said the restructuring exercise should be meticulous, adding that it shall only be conducted when the commissariat department is satisfied with the quality of work produced.",1
"EDITORIAL COMMENT: ZiG acceptance to spur market confidence, stability",https://www.herald.co.zw/editorial-comment-zig-acceptance-to-spur-market-confidence-stability/,"AS the ZiG continues to strengthen, gaining just over 2,2 percent against the US dollar since its launch two and half weeks ago, it has now been fully accepted by the formal Zimbabwean business community, including those who had tried to switch to pure US dollar transactions. The important regional airline fastjet is now accepting payment for tickets in ZiG, meaning it is confident that it can pay its own bills in that currency or buy the necessary foreign currency for any imports. That particular airline works to very tight profit margins, so there is no padding that would allow it to ever use the black market, so it is obviously confident. There is also general public acceptance. Manufacturers and retailers report no panic buying, no shortages and generally just normal shopping, normal demand and normal supplies. The ZiG is now being given a fair chance to prove its worth. A major factor in its acceptance is its stability. Although there has been marginal daily strengthening on each of the 11 trading days within the commercial banking system since the launch, even more important has been the minuscule extent of each daily change, usually somewhere around a quarter of a percent or less, the same sort of changes likely in most stable currencies. Reserve Bank Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu sees the decision that half of the normal quarterly tax payments must be paid in ZiG as a contributing factor to the strengthening. Businesses need to hang on to more of their ZiGs to meet their tax bills. So everything is coming together. The use of the US dollar had reached around 80 percent of all transactions, and that percentage is now falling, perhaps slowly at first, but as acceptance rises we can expect more businesses and more people to be using ZiGs. Dr Mushayavanhu thought that once around half of transactions were in ZiGs, then the sharp distinctions between what currency was being used would largely disappear. It would basically depend on what the customer making the purchase had in which bank account. The swings we grew accustomed to with the unbacked Zimbabwe dollar could and did trigger price rises based on what the honest thought could be the exchange rate in a couple of weeks and what the dishonest wanted to use to profiteer. While the direction of the daily change is less important than the small scale of the daily change, the strengthening seen since the launch is certainly an additional bonus, showing that the fundamentals were in place. The interbank mid-exchange rate moved from ZiG13,5616 to the US dollar at launch to ZiG13,2536 yesterday. The strengthening also shows that the markets accept the scale of the foreign currency and gold reserves backing the currency. Dr Mushayavanhu yesterday told a joint sitting of the Portfolio Committees on Budget, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion and of Industry and Commerce that the Reserve Bank had reserves of US$100 million in cash and nostro balances and gold reserves worth US$185 million. He also stressed that the official interbank exchange rate is not set by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Government. It is generated as the weighted average of what each of the private sector commercial banks are prepared to pay when they buy foreign currency from willing sellers, and the rate each uses when they sell that foreign currency to a willing buyer. This is a major reform and finally ends the interference in exchange rates by the authorities that has been in place since the local currency was delinked from sterling almost 60 years ago. The acceptance of the currency, the willingness to use banks to fund imports and sell export proceeds, and the retreat from the back market has been helped by the action against black market dealers. Police operations against black market dealers saw 65 arrested last weekend in sting operations, and there were the actions of the Financial Intelligence Unit in uncovering businesses that were not accepting ZiGs and then freezing their accounts. While the police operations against street dealers will help, largely by making it a lot more expensive to deal in the black market, there is a need to go beyond these petty dealers or agents of the major dealers, and tackle those who largely manage and manipulate the black market and accumulate the larger sums that some businesses used to buy when they went to the black market. While some street dealers are independent, buying and selling tiny amounts, others are connected to a quite different breed who deal with a pack of street dealers, and there were even higher levels of those who dealt with a group of these initial accumulators. The market was always messy. While rounding up the foot soldiers is useful, it will be fairly easy to replace those who are forced to withdraw. So a determined effort to track down and bring to court the kingpins in the black market will be a major blow against illegal dealing. These are the people who have the capital to fund the dealing at a major level, and will be hard to replace. We assume that the courts would be interested in significant jail sentences for breaches of the Exchange Control Act that involve larger sums, so getting a handle on this group is important. Perhaps it can be explained to the smaller fry that becoming accomplice witnesses can earn them freedom. But pressure on the black market dealers will also make their dealing less profitable and as they increase margins between what they pay for foreign currency and what they sell that currency for to cope with higher costs, such as fines, confiscations and lawyer bills, the market will become ever less attractive as customers at each end feel ever more cheated. The use and acceptance of the ZiG relies on a swathe of factors, but the authorities now seem to have touched each point and so just as ill effects can snowball, so can the positive factors.",3
FUZ give ZIFA Ultimatum on Chirinda saga,https://www.herald.co.zw/fuz-give-zifa-ultimatum-on-chirinda-saga/,"Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter FOOTBALLERS Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) are getting increasingly frustrated with how authorities have been dealing with striker Obriel Chirinda’s raging transfer saga with the player’s trade union body on Monday giving ZIFA a 48-hour ultimatum to intervene. Chirinda is at the centre of controversy after allegedly signing two contracts with giants Dynamos and reigning league champions Ngezi Platinum Stars. The Warriors fringe player reportedly first put pen to paper when Dynamos representatives visited him in Bulawayo in December. Despite having a running contract with Bulawayo Chiefs then, Chirinda accepted a deal with the Glamour Boys’ agents who paid him half of the amount they had agreed which is understood to be around US$6 000. However, Dynamos hit a brick wall as they tried to negotiate with Bulawayo Chiefs to release the player. It was during that period that league champions Ngezi Platinum Stars came knocking on the door for the player’s services and everything sailed through. The Premier Soccer League even registered Chirinda as a Ngezi player and issued him with a licence. Dynamos then approached the PSL with documents to prove that Chirinda was their player instead and the league subsequently withheld the striker’s licence citing that the matter had to be cleared first before he could be allowed to turn out for Ngezi. Since then, Chirinda has been grounded, despite training with Takesure Chiragwi’s team. The Premiership will begin Match Day 8 fixtures this afternoon but there will be no sign of Chirinda who scored 12 goals last season and helped Bulawayo Chiefs achieve a mid-table finish. Chirinda appeared to aid Dynamos’ complaint when he signed an affidavit admitting to having entered into a deal with the Harare giants before going into bed with Ngezi. However, FUZ feels the player has been given a raw deal by the domestic football authorities. FUZ president Desmond Maringwa is not happy with the manner the PSL has handled the matter. He said they had been engaging the league since March 19 to no avail. In the only correspondence they have sent to FUZ, PSL, insisted that they were not changing their stance to withhold Chirinda’s licence. “Obriel Chirinda has two contracts with Dynamos and Ngezi Platinum Stars FC. Further, the player received money from Dynamos FC as per the (attached) affidavit. There is no evidence to show that the money was paid back to Dynamos FC. “We, therefore, advise the player to regularise his contractual situation before he can be allowed to participate in Premier Soccer League competitions,” wrote PSL chief executive Kenny Ndebele in response to one of the FUZ’s many inquiries last month. Seeing that their continued engagement with the PSL has not yielded a conclusion to the saga, FUZ decided to approach ZIFA for some respite. In their letter to ZIFA chief executive Yvonne Manwa dated April 2, 2024, FUZ pleaded with the mother body to intervene in the matter. “We are deeply concerned with the way the matter of Obriel Chirinda is being handled by the Premier Soccer League and we have reminded them that they are not supposed to hold on to a player’s licence to play since his registration was done by the regulations on the registration of players and it is against the principles of natural justice,” wrote FUZ secretary-general Wonder Sithole. “PSL has no right to adjudicate nor pass a decision in any dispute involving a player and a club as this is the sole responsibility of the FA’s competent judiciary body. “This case has not been brought to ZIFA by any club so as far as we are concerned there is no dispute brought in light of the DRC (Dispute Resolution Chamber) responsible for dealing with this matter . . . “We appeal to your esteemed office to intervene and correct this anomaly before it causes more harm to football as we believe procedural rules should take precedence in all matters regardless of what we perceive to think or know.” But exactly 20 days after sending the correspondence to ZIFA, FUZ has also not heard from the Normalisation Committee running ZIFA. And on Monday, Sithole made a follow-up with Manwa giving the association a 24-hour ultimatum to intervene. “We are making a follow-up on the matter exactly 20 days after our last communication and nothing has been done and the player’s licence is still being held up by the Premier Soccer League. “This injustice must be eradicated in our football and I do not know why it takes this long for the association to follow laid down regulations in allowing the player to play for his registered club since no case was reported and again even if there is a dispute because such pending disputes should not stop players from rendering service by the FIFA RSTP.” Chirinda was one of the hottest properties on the market in the off-season after a solid season at Bulawayo Chiefs which he capped by winning the Soccer Star of the Year runner-up medal. His 12 goals made him the second-best scorer in the league with a goal behind Golden Boot winner Takunda Benhura of Ngezi. But in a year, he was expected to reach new heights, Chirinda remains on the sidelines watching in agony as Ngezi struggles in front of goal, thanks to the ongoing saga. The raging dispute has also diminished his chances of making the Warriors’ squad ahead of the senior team’s World Cup qualifying campaign. Chirinda had appeared to have found his way into the national team during Brazilian coach Brito’s short stint with the Warriors.",3
Energy investments help improve electricity supplies,https://www.herald.co.zw/energy-investments-help-improve-electricity-supplies/,"Bulawayo Bureau THE completion of the 600MW Hwange Thermal Power Station Units 7 and 8 project last year and the increasing private sector investment in renewable energy has cushioned Zimbabwe from extensive load shedding, at a time when power generation at the giant Kariba Hydro Power Station has been crippled by low water levels due to drought. The El Nino weather conditions have disrupted rainfall patterns  across Southern Africa, resulting in low inflows being recorded at Kariba Dam, forcing the Zambezi Water Authority to restrict power generation at the Kariba Hydro Power Station, which now produces less than 300MW against its installed capacity of 1 050MW. In the past such reduction in power generation would have resulted in extensive power cuts as the country was not generating adequate electricity to meet domestic consumer and industry demands. However, following the commissioning of the US$1,4 billion Hwange Unit 7 and 8 project by President Mnangagwa last year, the power situation has improved with the private sector players, riding on enhanced Government support, also coming on board to generate renewable energy to ease the pressure on the grid. Energy and Power Development Permanent Secretary, Engineer Gloria Magombo, yesterday said the situation could have been worse without the positive investment strides in building new energy capacity. “The reduction in electricity generation is already happening because we are averaging around 200MW already (at Kariba Hydro Power Station). But what has mitigated and reduced the impact from the previous years is the coming in of Hwange Unit 7 and 8,” she said. “It has brought in an average of 600MW, which was not there in the previous years when we had challenges,” said Eng Magombo. “You might find out that yes we have challenges, especially when Unit 1 to 6 are struggling and they are down. But the impact is much-much less compared to the actual megawatts, which we have lost.” The Permanent Secretary said the private sector was also complementing the Government in power generation through renewable energy projects. “The private sector has also taken an initiative to build new capacity to ensure security. Over the past five years we have seen a significant growth in the power generation for our own consumption,” said Dr Magombo. “The private sector has taken the initiative through what we call commercial and industrial systems to build their own power stations. In Matabeleland South, we have seen the likes of 12MW, which was built by Caledonia Mine in Gwanda. “We are expecting a new 10MW plant in Bulawayo and another 20MW in Colleen Bawn (Gwanda). So, in total 30 MW, which is going to be built by PPC for their own consumption,” she said. The Permanent Secretary said mining companies across the country are building solar power generation plants with one of the significant one being built in Masvingo and Mashonaland West. “When I’m talking about the 35MW, the 12MW I think we have over 50MW, which is being built by the private sector for their own consumption and that does alleviate the pressure off the grid,” she said. “We are seeing the steel company (Manhize), they will come in with an additional 50MW, which they will also produce from the residual from their heat processes.” Dr Magombo said the Renewable Energy Policy has even seen insurance and pensions fund players unlocking value through investing in big solar plants with one of the projects being the one at Cross Mabale in Matabeleland North. She said the private sector’s investment in the energy sector is a product of the country’s Renewable Energy Policy, which was launched in 2019. The deliberate policy saw the Government removing the importation duty for those who were bringing renewable energy equipment in the country. Eng Magombo said even household solar users have increased due to the removal of the import duty. While independent power producers were reluctant to invest in the energy sector due to failure to guarantee surety of their investment, the Government has become a guarantor in their investments. This has seen IPPs also contributing to the national grid, which never used to happen in the past. “We have seen the increase in new investments as major projects were struggling because they were citing the issue of guarantees. The Government through the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, has come up with a Government implementation agreement and this agreement assures the IPPs that once they sold their power to Zesa, they will be allowed to be paid their requirements and if Zesa fails then Government becomes the guarantor. Those are some of the incentives that have been put in place,” she said. Eng Magombo said the Government has also restructured the country’s energy market allowing extensive power consumers to buy power from independent producers, which never used to happen. “We have also restructured the market to ensure that large intensive energy users can buy directly from independent power producers, which gives them assurance of being paid timeously, especially when Zesa in the past used to have challenges,” she said. “We are going through one of the worst droughts in the country and we all need to use energy efficiently. We know it’s going to be a difficult time and we urge people to brace up and reduce consumption and use the energy efficiently. “But those who have capacity, especially the large consumers, we are asking them to come in and also build additional capacity and take off the pressure from Zesa,” said Eng Magombo. She encouraged investment in the renewable energy sector saying it is something that can be gradually done. -@nqotshili",0
National heroine Jadagu leaves indelible mark,https://www.herald.co.zw/national-heroine-jadagu-leaves-indelible-mark/,"Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter National heroine, Cde Tsitsi Grace Jadagu, was a dedicated and fearless character who contributed immensely during and after the liberation struggle, friends and political allies have said. The  national heroine worked closely with Cdes Shuvai Mahofa, Ruth Chinamano, Sabina Mugabe, and Pamela Tungamirai. She also worked closely with Zanu PF Politburo members Cdes Omega Hungwe, Cde Idah Mashonganyika, and Tsitsi Munyati, among others. Cde Hungwe described the  national heroine as a patriotic cadre who loved her country wholeheartedly. “She worked tirelessly for the party. She was a hardworking and no-nonsense person when it came to issues about Zanu PF. “She was part of a group of women who set up party districts in Harare,” said Cde Hungwe. Zanu PF Harare provincial chairwoman Cde Ratidzo Mukarati described Cde Jadagu as a motherly figure and a fearless cadre, who wanted justice among Zimbabweans. “We used to call her Minister of Justice because she wanted justice to prevail. She was a problem solver.” Cde Mukarati also said the  national heroine championed empowerment programmes for women in Zimbabwe. “She initiated a number of projects for women in Zimbabwe. She opened a number of market places for women.” Zanu PF Harare provincial vice chairman Cde Ephraim Fundukwa described Cde Jadagu as a reliable person. “She was a reliable person in terms of giving advice in line with the party constitution. She advised me to stick to the party constitution whenever making decisions,” said Cde Fundukwa. Former Harare provincial Political Commissar Cde Shadreck Mashayamombe described the  national heroine as a great mobiliser. “Whatever she touched would turn into gold as she fought for black empowerment. She was upright, frank and forthright so much that if you were a sell-out she would say so right in your face. “She championed the establishment of housing cooperatives to ensure everyone has access to decent shelter. She is one of the pioneers of housing cooperatives in Zimbabwe,” said Cde Mashayamombe. Zanu PF District Coordinating Committee Zone 2 chairman Cde Godwin Gomwe said he worked closely with the  national heroine, who will be buried on Monday, when he was Harare provincial youth chairman. “She used to give us strategies on youth empowerment initiatives as part of a broader mobilisation strategy,” said Cde Gomwe. Cde Jadagu was born on 11 March 1943 in Murehwa, Mashonaland East Province. She attended Murehwa Mission School and Domboshava Training Centre. She trained as a police officer before she switched and trained as a teacher at Nyadire Mission in 1960. During the struggle she was a war collaborator and after independence, she served as councillor for Chitungwiza Municipality Ward 16 and was later appointed special Interest Councillor in 2013. She was appointed a Senator in 2014. Cde Jadagu started her political career when she was 17 years old in Mangwende Village, where her father’s brother was a chief and an active member of ZAPU.  During the time her family, led by Chief Mangwende, had a conflict with the Rhodesian native commissioner over national politics. The whole family was then forced out of the village over that issue, which resulted in them seeking refuge in Old Highfield. That is when she became a member of the Youth in ZAPU together with the late Cdes Sabina Mugabe, Tsitsi Munyati, Ruth Chinamano, and others. The  national heroine was a Women’s League Political Commissar in 1983, a Central Committee member, and a member of the National Consultative Assembly. She worked closely with President Mnangagwa and the late national hero Cde Solomon Mujuru to set up Zanu PF political party offices at 88 Manica Road. She also served in the Zimbabwe Republic Police under the Special Constabulary Branch. The national heroine Cde Jadagu was honoured as the Best Woman Sergeant, Best Councillor (1999), and Best Leader of Netball Social Club (1999) in Chitungwiza. She is survived by seven children, six daughters and one son. Mourners are gathered at 6979 Unit J, Chitungwiza.",1
Actress Chipidza gets chance to shine on continental stage,https://www.herald.co.zw/actress-chipidza-gets-chance-to-shine-on-continental-stage/,"Valerie Mpundu Arts Reporter Local actress Chimwemwe Chipidza is set to represent Zimbabwe in Uganda on May 24 at the Africa Monologue Challenge, a prestigious competition where actors from the continent compete for a lead role in a Pan-African film, among other exciting prizes. The challenge gives budding and aspiring actors the ultimate chance to showcase their talent to the global community. In a landscaped video of not more than one minute, the monologue is usually on a plain background with very clear audio and recorded in English. Chipidza is among the top 10 finalists together with representatives from Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Cote d’Ivoire, Cameroon and Malawi. In an interview, Chipidza, described her journey as one that has been a great experience and a learning curve. She is happy to take part in the African Monologue Challenge and said: “This is a good move for me. “This is not the first time trying this challenge and at first, I was not successful. I then tried my luck again this time it came running.” “I was very sceptical but gathered the courage to participate and to my surprise I was one of the 50 finalists.” Chipidza said evictions would happen every two weeks and she kept holding. “I am glad I managed to be one of the 10 finalists. “The monologue to me is good as it strengthens my resolve to explore cultural connections while giving an African narrative. “I like to explore cultural connections and promote Pan-African collaborations. I have high hopes and dreams for this continent. “In my work I aim to build unity and cooperation between various cultures.” Chipidza ,who started acting in high school plays, said this ignited her passion as it helped in building a strong and confident person. In 2016 she played in the drama “Much Ado About Nothing” at the British Embassy as they commemorated English playwright and poet William Shakespeare, giving her the much needed experience and recognition. Adding a notch to her belt in 2017, Chipidza assumed the role of assistant director in the film “Cook Off”. In 2020 she acted in “Blue Roof”,  a College Central Production series.

US$600m cervical cancer fund to benefit Zim,https://www.herald.co.zw/us600m-cervical-cancer-fund-to-benefit-zim/,"Rumbidzayi Zinyuke Senior Health Reporter Zimbabwe is set to benefit from a US$600 million World Health Organisation (WHO) cervical cancer funding programme targeting developing countries disproportionately affected by the disease. The country is ranked fourth among the states  heavily burdened with cervical cancer globally, with an estimated 3 000 new cases diagnosed each year. The funding, if granted, will empower the Government to bolster its cervical cancer prevention, screening and treatment services. A WHO team from Geneva led by director for non-communicable diseases Dr Bente Mikkelsen was in the country this week as part of the cervical cancer elimination Initiative mission meant to assess the impact of the disease in three countries. Besides Zimbabwe, the team also visited Zambia and Sierra Leone. Speaking before touring various health facilities that offer cervical cancer services in Harare and Mashonaland Central on Sunday, Dr Mikkelsen said the country had to lobby for the release of the funds. “For the first time ever since we introduced the director general Tedros’ flagship programme on cervical cancer elimination, we have seen partners coming together so there was a pledge of US$600 million. “This is not money they send to us unfortunately, this is money that we try to trigger from our partners. If we are able to get a succinct list of asks, this is the way we can bring partners together.” She said the main purpose of the mission was to assess what the country had done towards elimination of cervical cancer as well as take note of the challenges being faced. According to statistics, more than 70 percent of all women diagnosed with cervical cancer do not survive, making the disease a leading cause of mortality among women in the country. Cervical cancer is however the most preventable and treatable cancer. Dr Mikkelsen said the country was on the right path in implementing strategies to eliminate the disease. She, however, stressed the need to increase screening to curb the rise of severe cases of cervical cancer. “Because if we screen, we can treat it before it develops to a heavy cancer. And to achieve that, we need to integrate it in the HIV services, but not only that, as you do here with the schools for advocacy and awareness, but also into other non-communicable disease programmes,” she added. Health and Child Care Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora said the Government remains committed to eliminating cervical cancer by 2030. “Zimbabwe’s stance against this preventable disease is bold and multifaceted, ensuring equitable access to primary prevention, screening and early detection, as well as treatment and care. “Over 200 healthcare facilities across Zimbabwe now offer VIAC screenings, and 60 locations provide HPV tests. These expanded services are empowering women with the tools for early detection,” he said. However, reaching women in rural Zimbabwe with screening services remains a challenge. Minister Mombeshora said the Government was also ramping up efforts to increase HPV vaccination rates. Efforts are currently underway to develop an HPV vaccination revitalisation action plan which will ensure that no eligible girl is left behind. For those diagnosed with cervical cancer, he said the Government was investing in more radiotherapy equipment to offer the most effective treatments.",4
‘Digital economy key to transforming livelihoods’,https://www.herald.co.zw/digital-economy-key-to-transforming-livelihoods/,"Mthabisi Tshuma Bulawayo Bureau DEVELOPING a vibrant digital economy is at the heart of the Government’s transformation agenda as Zimbabwe leverages modern technology to positively impact people’s livelihoods in line with Vision 2030. Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services Minister, Dr Tatenda Mavetera, said this yesterday during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) Digital Economy Conference in Bulawayo. “The digital economy stands as a cornerstone of progress in the 21st century, driving innovation, creating opportunities, and revolutionising the way we conduct business and interact with the world. “In the digital age, our economy is no longer bound by physical constraints. It is defined by the flow of information, the exchange of ideas, and the connectivity that binds us all,” said Minister Mavetera. She was addressing delegates virtually, and stressed the Government’s commitment to spreading development equitably to all areas, adding that the digital economy will support the Second Republic’s mantra of leaving no one and no place behind. “Our agenda is ambitious but achievable. We strive to leave no one and no place as championed by the President, His Excellency Dr ED Mnangagwa. “We aim to bridge the digital divide, empower our citizens with digital literacy, and create a robust infrastructure that can support the ever-growing demands of the digital landscape,” said Dr Mavetera. “As we delve into the depths of this digital era, it is imperative that we foster an environment that encourages creativity, ensures cybersecurity, and promotes inclusivity. “Our gathering here marks a significant moment in our journey towards a future shaped by digital innovation and economic transformation. As we embark on this pivotal event, I am filled with a sense of optimism and enthusiasm for the transformative potential that lies within the digital sphere. “I am acutely aware of the profound impact that technology and digitalization have on our societies, economies, and daily lives.” The minister said the Digital Economy Conference serves as a platform to collectively explore the boundless possibilities that the digital economy offers. “It is a forum for collaboration, learning, and the exchange of ideas that will shape the future of our nation and the global community. “Together, we have the opportunity to harness the power of technology to address societal challenges, foster economic growth, and enhance the well-being of our citizens,” she said. “We are committed to nurturing start-ups, supporting tech giants, and, most importantly, protecting the rights and privacy of our digital citizens. I urge each of you to engage in meaningful dialogue, to challenge conventional thinking, and to seek out innovative solutions to the complex issues we face in the digital age,” said Dr Mavetera implored business leaders and communities to embrace the diversity of thought and expertise, saying through this diversity “we’ll unlock the full potential of the digital economy”. “Let’s be guided by the principles of collaboration, innovation, and responsibility. “Let us pledge to not only adapt to the changes brought about by the digital revolution but to lead the charge in defining its course,” said Dr Mavetera. “As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology and connectivity, let us remain steadfast in our commitment to inclusivity, accessibility, and ethical stewardship of digital resources. “By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of the digital economy are shared equitably and sustainably, leaving no one behind. “I am confident that the discussions and collaborations that unfold during this conference will serve as catalysts for progress, driving us towards a future defined by technological innovation, economic prosperity, and societal advancement,” said Dr Mavetera.",4
